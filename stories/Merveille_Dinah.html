    <h2>A Letter from an Old Friend</h2>
    <blockquote>
    <p>My sword friend William,</p>
    <p>I wonder if  you are doing well, though I have heard the sad news about your wife. The lost of her should've caused so much sadness on you, I cannot even fathom it. I'm really sorry to hear about this. I know you loved her dearly. </p>
    <p>I imagine your mind is full of dark thought and you feel hollow. But dear friend of mine. Even though your partner has left you so early in this world, You cannot think about giving up. You still have a daughter to rise, which is not a easy task at all. I don't want to bother with you so many words so I will keep this letter short and straight.</p>
    <p>You know that I do also have daughter, which is almost the same age yours. And for the sake of her growing up in a simple life I am living in a small town of Cantellia, albeit my wife isn't happy being around here. My daughter happens to lack playmates in her age. So come here with your little one.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>That's was the letter William has recieved while he was drinking himself out in a bar. Since the day her wife's illness reached to a fatal degree and with no possible cure he was already drinking. </p>
    <p>"Heh! He does not even ask if I want to go to such a place! Giving me an order so that I put my ass together." he said in a mocking tone, but his lips still curled up a little.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile Dinah, (the poor daughter who has lost her mother and with a drunkard father) was drying some cups with a dry rag. She somewhat in this situation become a little worker in the bar and friends with the daughter of the bar (with about 15 year age difference). </p>
    <p>"Dinah! Come here, I do have some news for you."</p>
    <p>Dinah, who was so focused to dry the cups got irked, almost dropping the cup. But she is a big girl at the age of four, so she wouldn't drop a cup. She put down (or up since she is to short) the cup to the table. With some pitter-patter sound she darted near.</p>
    <p>William give the letter to Dinah, but the little girl just looked at her father as asking what is she supposed to do with this paper. </p>
    <p>"Why are you looking like that, go ahead and read it."</p>
    <p>Which made Dinah even more confused. She knew there is a concept of  <em>reading</em> but the problem is she still didn't learn such skill. She knows how to count the cups. She also knows how to dry them. But she doesn't know how to read images on paper, yet. </p>
    <p>At that point an angry girl, who is still not married even though has reached the age of 19, come to the father-daughter duo. </p>
    <p>"Which kid knows to read at this age! If you want her to know go find someone to teach. Instead of wasting all your money here." The girl, who is a friend of Dinah, came to rescue of the little girl. </p>
    <p>"I knew how to read at that age! Also, all the money I put goes to your father's pocket. Why are you angry about that. She even helps you in the kitchen." </p>
    <p>At that point, the daughter of the bar got so angry but cannot find anything to say and just looked angrly. </p>
    <p>"Heh, you can get happy. I am leaving on dawn. Dinah go ahead and make your own luggage."</p>
    <p>Just when Dinah took out her make-shift apron, made by old dress, and was about to leave the bar, "Also, I'm not going to carry your things. Only take whatever you can carry." </p>
    <p>"Hoi! You are not going to leave her somewhere are you!? Even if you are friend of my father I will mop the floor if  you - "</p>
    <p>But before she finished her threathaning William was already out of the bar. </p>
    <p>...</p>
    <p>...</p>

    <h2>A Long Trip to Cantellia</h2>
    <p>Dinah, who is a clever and practical girl, didn't put much into her bag. The bag which could be fastened around the shoulder and to a belt was very easy to carry. Of course, such a convinient item only be bought by her mother. Dinah was proud of her mother who bought such a useful thing for her (it was her mother's all along but it is same thing for her).</p>
    <p>She packed four pants two shirts and a skirt. She was going to wear one set of skirt and shirt. On top of it a cape for the nights (and also to hide a weapon, as how his father does). And with her headband with a nice red dahlia woven by she had everything she needed. She even had extra space to put. Other girls around needed so many space for clothes and dolls. But Dinah as a big girl didn't need such things. But she carried some ragged cloth. Which, was cleaned as much as it was possible with the cold water of the well. </p>
    <p>"Dinah, put those into your bag. This is oil and this a sharpening stone. This one is a flint stick. You could light a fire with a knife and this. Do you have anything to use in case of injury?"
    Which explained why Dinah carried those ragged cloth, as she showed the inside of her bag.</p>
    <p>"They'll do it fine. I am packing alcohol in case of any injury. So keep these dry herbs as well. Do not ever think about get your things stolen." Seeing the empty space in his daughter's bag, he added more. </p>
    <p>At that point Dinah was thinking even if they were to use that much wine to disenfect the wound they couldn't treat it with the cloth or herb they carried anyways. 'Well, he is going to drink them on the way.' Thought Dinah, in her head. </p>
    <hr>
    <p>When the sun was about to rise, Dinah was snoring lightly. Only to be irked slightly. Yet, without opening her eyes she stayed still. Putting more strenght to the wooden knife, which was a 15cm long flat plank with cloth wrapped for the handle, she hide in between her thighs. </p>
    <p>Wondering why she is not hearing the footsteps of her father these days. Is she sleeping that heavy? </p>
    <p>While thinking about the recent wake-up situation the door creaked open. And the door connection shrieked as if in pain, as if asking 'please give a little bit of grease'. </p>
    <p>"Time to get up. We are leaving in five minutes. Be ready at the enterance on clock or I go alone."</p>
    <p>After hearing the instructions from her father, Dinah opened her eyes. And wore her clothes in a quick and practiced manner. As if she trained herself to optimize wearing her clothes. She was proud of herself for her practicallity. 'If there was a commetion for wearing clothes I would be the first, at least the second!' Thought to herself.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile William was waiting with a cigar in his mouth. Thinking about what's wrong about her daughter. He didn't teach her how to sleep light. Since being a mercenary in his youth, and later becoming a soldier and becoming an aide for a commander (aka the friend waiting in the village), he is used to sleep like that. Even after retiring he kept sleeping with a knife, old habits die hard. </p>
    <p>The problem isn't that her daughter copying his way of sleeping. He could also make a reasoning for her being a light-sleeper. But recently he started walk with soft padded shoes and in a way which makes no sound. But his daughter still woke up before he enters the room. This kind of  sensing isn't something you can gain without sleeping in small trenches. 'Well probably he got it from my gens. I wonder , why she didn't get my acting skills though? It's so obvious she is faking her sleep.' </p>
    <p>While thinking about the biological process of inheriting skills, and filling his lungs with the cigar smoke, a little Dinah appeared next to him. </p>
    <p>"Let's go, we are becoming farmers or whatever your uncle Dern is doing. Call him uncle he'd love it. But he is even stricter than me. As he was my commander in military and war."</p>
    <p>Dinah, who had no idea about where they were going and why they were going only nodded her head. Questioning when she got a uncle? And thinking about her life a farm-girl and considering which crops are better to farm. But her knowledge led her not much, and she decided to first learn from her new uncle and then think about it later.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>The distance to the town was about 10 days on horse back, with fast horses trained for urgencies it could be shortened to less than a week. Though, there is not way they have such horse. And they are going with a carriage which also carries a different family, an old couple which is going to beyond their destination. It's cheap this way even though it will take about three weeks at the shortest time.</p>
    <p>Dinah keeping her bag as her pillow was sleeping lightly. William just bored and looking outside. The old lady knitting something and the old man reading a poem book. </p>
    <p>At some point Dinah opened to her eyes to crow shriek. </p>
    <p>Thinking it was wasteful to sleep around she started to think what she can do. 
    Indoor training was not possible. First, she didn't know how to train. His father also does not train so she does not know about it. </p>
    <p>Thinking about her possessions in the bag she concluded there is also nothing to use in. </p>
    <p>At that point she looked at her father, and thought he was doing nothing useful that she could learn. She already mastered how to sleep looking his father. </p>
    <p>At some point she realized a pair of eyes on her. Which made her look at the source of the gaze. Her eyes met with the old guy, and then down to the book in his hand. 'I am still not capable of reading.' while thinking about how she could learn it, the old man called her;</p>
    <p>"Are you interested in this book?" The old man (Which is just an old man no reason to feel scared lol.) had a nice inviting smile. He probably has many grand-child. </p>
    <p>"Yes, though I don't know how to read a book."</p>
    <p>"That's all right, if you want to learn I can teach you." </p>
    <p>Dinah, who has heard many times from her father that; 'there is no such thing as free lunch', said with a doubtful face.</p>
    <p>"I don't have money, sir. I also don't carry anything that I could afford giving."</p>
    <p>Which made the old man chuckle. After making a humming sound and thinking a little.</p>
    <p>"Than your compensation for my teaching will be to read this page from start to finish." He said as pointing to the first page of the book.</p>
    <p>Dinah, who also learned that labor can be used as a currency, and thinking that reading was a chore, since otherwise why her father never read anything at all, she agreed to this. </p>
    <p>William didn't even give look about what was going on.</p>
    <p>The old lady just kept knitting. A bit sore why the girl wasn't intersted in knitting.</p>
    <p>Because of the weather condition and the news about the bandits, the carriage took detour. Which caused them to reach the town in a month. 
    In the journey Dinah learned how to read. And she didn't only read but also memorised the page the old man asked for her. Which turned out to be a sutra for the Light Religion. The old man was really good at brain-washing a little kid to believe in god. 
    Though little Dinah didn't understand anything, the sutra was so poetic for her. And she wondered who is <em>He</em>. </p>
    <p>In the long month she also learned how to knit from the old lady. For payment she patched some clothes old lady has given to her. </p>
    <p>Dinah, who has done such a good job at needle work, even got a tip on top of her learning. A silver needle. Now as long as she had some cloth and some thread she could patch any clothing.</p>
    <hr>

    <h2>The town</h2>
    <p>The town which accomadates about 40 families in it, which is a bit on larger side to be a village but too small for a town, was the place. </p>
    <p>William reaching the town with the little girl asked around to find where his friend resides. That's the most logical thing, it is efficient to ask around to find where you are looking instead of randomly moving around. Dinah, whenever her father become to drunk to find the way learned this lesson quite early.</p>
    <p>However there was a bit absurd yet curious face on Little Dinah's face, which could be mistaken as musing on a new place she is going to live. Alas, she really did have such thinking in her little brain. But the cause of her facial change has come from her father's actions.</p>
    <p>Normally he wouldn't make small talk or smile much to random people. And never uses a polite tone wether he talks to and elderly or a respectable looking man or a soldier in the city. And never shows an approachable face to younger ones. </p>
    <p>This day however, she has seen her father acting in a strange way. 'Isn't the reason for keeping a straight face is the common?' thought Dinah, and considered maybe she also needs to great people with a smile. She even learned about curtising from her work-mate big sister. She didn't put the practice in real life action to this day.</p>
    <p>"Hello mam, I beg your pardon for distrubting your work. I have come to this sweet town to live here with my daughter, at the recommendation of my sword friend in military. He is called xx, do you happen to know where he lives?"</p>
    <p>"Hi lady, what a nice day, this humble daughter is called Dinah." The little tag along daughter, even to surprise her own father, curtised and greeted the old lady. Almost making William to think if she is really his daughter and check with the corner of his eyes.</p>
    <p>The old lady seeing both daughter and father with little luggage and this sweet attitude also smiled. Hearing about the name of the respectable young man xx, she already had a positive bias on them. 
    "This old lady knows everyone in this little town, I do believe the guy is on the check the around the town. How about you keep me a little company until the sun raises a bit more?"</p>
    <p>And for a while there was some small talk in between the old lady and the father-daughter duo. But the talk of the elder people came short, and the old lady who learned the poor girls situation started to talk with Dinah. </p>
    <p>"Little Dinah, do you happen to know doing embodiery?" The old lady showed what is such a task showing a handkerchief with a tulip motife made by her.</p>
    <p>Dinah shaking her head. "I have not learned such dexterious work. I do know how to count cups and dry them. I do know how to read a book. And, a little bit of needle work to patch torn clothes. I don't think I can make such beautiful creation of needle work." Dinah, who told about her all skill set, pointed to the pulips on the cloth. She didn't know what was so beautiful about flowers. But her mother has gifted her a headband with a dahlia, and her work-mate also liked flowers. So she assumed flower is a thing liked by females, and played around.</p>
    <p>"Oh dear, it is not as hard as you might assume. And, with such clever and pretty young lady, such as yourself can of course, learn it." the lady hearing about the girl knowing how to read actually went ahead and pointed to a shelf, which contains a couple jar and a book. </p>
    <p>"Could you bring that old book to me, and if I am not troubling you can you read some pages to me again. This old lady has trouble of reading."</p>
    <p>nod, pitter-patter</p>
    <p>"Which page shall I read for you?"</p>
    <p>"Could you open the second last page in it."</p>
    <p>Dinah, with the instruction opened the book. And the little girl who only trained about reading religious poems was a bit in luck, since it seemed this one is also a poem. Dinah, who only seen poetic writing with great margins didn't think much and started to read the poem.</p>
    <p>The poem was about a honey bee who wants to only go to one dear flower, nourish and company it until the flower withers, and to wither along with it. Dinah, thinking why the honey-bee is dumb to wasting his time to only one flower and withering along with it commented on nothing. </p>
    <p>"This was a poem did my old husband has written me when I was a young dear girl. What do you think?"</p>
    <p>Dinah who has no idea flowers can marry to a bee and then turn into old ladies when they wither made an educated run-away answer she learned from her father, directing a question with another one: "So Salume old lady was a beautiful pulip back then?"</p>
    <p>"What a sweet honey-tongued young lady your are," Old lady has chuckled heartly to this pleasantary, and started to pet the confused Dinah.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile William, realizing her daughter not only gotten his light-sleeping but also sweet talking excersized the thought of  'What is the reason of ricing an old lady? She is as dumb as her mother.'</p>
    <p>After this points of events a man with broad shoulders walked towards them, shouting. His neatly trimmed and combed beard showing his care and dicipline on himself. The sword and knife fastened to his waist, and the small hammer he carried on one hand made a unique combination. Dinah, though he was a bishop who works as guard and carpenter. </p>
    <p>"Are my eyes seeing right through or the old age made me imagine my old sword friend, William."</p>
    <p>"It is of course imagination of yours. How a William would come to this sweet town." mocking</p>
    <p>"Yes that's true, my friend is a father of a little angel now. He wouldn't by any chance make a move on dear lady Salume, like his old fast times." Darl made mocking in a absurd way and prompting to his old skirt-chaser life.</p>
    <p>William rolling his eyes and thinking it was not him but her daughter didn't have much to add. </p>
    <p>Darl when he made an eye-contact with Dinah also got a nice but similar greeting.</p>
    <p>"Hello sir, this humble daughter of William is called Dinah. Thanks for your service in such a early hour."</p>
    <p>Darl who is shocked by the education and temperment from the <em>daughter of William</em>, that William... so Darl also used a much nicer tone.</p>
    <p>"Forgive my rudeness of asking. How old is this young lady this year?"</p>
    <p>"Sir, I'm to be five by the next full moon."</p>
    <hr>
    <p>After some time has passed, with the two old friend filling each other with their recent life. Darl takes Willam and his daughter to the small house, which has been not used for a long time. Though the town is located in a forested area, the town with many bad history of burning houses, uses stone as their house making. Thus, the condition is only bad for dust accumating for a long time.</p>
    <p>"Here, you two could share this little house. It's not to be paid so if you wanna go to somewhere better you will need to pay for it."</p>
    <p>"There are countless days my bedding was the cold wet dirt and my blanket was starry sky. A roof on top of me is enough."</p>
    <p>Darl, who agrees to sleeping anywhere by himself, cannot tolarate the notion of not wanting a better enviorement for his daughter. Yet, does not make comment as thinking his friend might be trying to be humble on its own accord.</p>
    <p>"Leave whatever luggage you have here for now. We shall visit the town mayor first. Young lady may come to my place to if she is tired of the long trip?"</p>
    <p>Dinah, to gauge his father's thought looked at his face, which gives no information. Assuming that he is either way annoyed she chooses to follow them.</p>
    <p>"I really wish to visit your house and family sir, But I shall also pay visit to the Mayor alongside my father."</p>
    <p>Seeing a daughter who is attached to her father made Darl's heart soften a litte. And thought if the lady of family would be more close to him, if to his partner has departed. But he quickly gave up on this thinking, as hoping for such wicked thought was not appoproate.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>After a five minutes of walking trio reached to a two stories house. Which looked much larger in comparison to other housings in the are. Which prompted to Dinah, 'So the leader of this area is the man called <em>Mayor</em>,'. </p>
    <p>"Young man Darl, so this is the sword friend you have talked about many times."</p>
    <p>The Old man with his grayed hair greeted Darl. Even though he looked old he was  still in strenght. As his back was straight and his deep voice was heard by clearly. 'Maybe you don't become dumb when your hair turns white?' Dinah, who has seen so many senile person where she has come, thought to herself.</p>
    <p>After some pleasenteries...</p>
    <p>"That little barrack has been used by my brother. He never married after his lover went with another man. He lived in there as a hunter of this town. I have no use for it, and rather let you stay there. There should also be some of his instruments for (Dinah: Is he a hunter who uses music? What was it called again, druid?) hunting."</p>
    <p>"I appreciate all your help for this humble father and my poor daughter. I will be a honest hunter for this sweet Cattelia."</p>
    <p>"Also, I shall be a honest huntress for Cattelia." The little girl chimmed in, as to be part of the community.</p>
    <p>"Ohhoh, a fair lady such as yourself shall take a more conversive job." Yet, he didn't hate a girl who wants to hardwork. And he patted the head of Dinah.</p>
    <p>Dinah, who has seen many boss cat who grooms their gang members and kitten thought she is being accepted to town. Which was a case even before she has set her little feet in the town...</p>
    <p>Darl, on the other hand had different opinions about the little girl. Even if it is a very rare case he has seen soldiers and even merceneries who are fairer-sex. Albeit he wishes such harsh jobs never taken by his daughter or this little lady, He also thinks having means to do if necessary isn't bad. </p>
    <p>Though, his bias on this mostly comes from Dinah. The little girl is hiding a make-shift knife in her robes even for now. She has probably gotten such habits from her father.</p>
    <p>"Well then, I am an old man who has retired. Yet, till I die people round here would call me Mayor. The formal mayor of this town is my son of law. He is an honest man. I, with my wife, lives in a small house. But not working doesn't do well to me. I come here to tend the plot behind."</p>
    <p>"Those two has met with Old lady Salume. She is also in light for this family." Darl, made a comment.</p>
    <p>"Oh! Well, then. I will ask my daughter to help you to clean around the house."
    "This humble man cannot ask for that."</p>
    <p>With some back and forth William who doesn't want to do any cleaning accepts the help without loosing face. </p>
