<hr>
<h2 id="the-labyrith">The Labyrith</h2>
<hr>
<p>A boy collecting little red shards from the grass covered ground. One
or two of them was not even worth to a penny but about a pouch of them
was enough get money for two breads. Where those shards were used for
the arms of the army. So even though the profit was shallow it was at
least something to have a little pride. Helping kingdom to fight with
demons.</p>
<p>While collecting shards from ground and removing the grass blade that
he pulled by mistake the boy murmured. “Just a little bit more and I
will be ten. Then I will enter the dollhouse labyrith from the adults
gate and gather so much shard.” Some small golems looked up to the boy
and made their round bodies lean forward while their hands hanging
downwards as if to show their exsapraterion towards little boy’s
dream.</p>
<p>One little golem which was as small as an infant human runned to a
huge bolder. Making some moves with its round stone arms and jumping
with the potato like legs. The movements of the little one shakes the
bolder? Since it does not move much and enormous the Guardian of golems
the giant golem (name) looks like a bolder. And its shake is just a way
of saying: give up you can’t reason with that boy.</p>
<p>“You know that the dolls on that part is not sweet as these little
rocks. Dolls attack anything that gets into the labyrith” A girl with
shoulder length hair, hit the boy with a stick on top of the head.</p>
<p>“Ouch! I am sure they are less violent than you.”</p>
<p>“I only hit you because you can’t understand the language of humans.
Just how many times do I need to warn you so that you see how dangerous
is that area.” The girl was stating her complains. She crouched near to
boy and started to collect the shards from ground.</p>
<p>“Hey! I found those shard go somewhere else to collect.”</p>
<p>“I wonder what story will the sister read tonight” the girl ignored
the boy compleately.</p>
<p>This was a place of the dollhouse labyrith where there was no doll
but golems. Called as Garden of Golems. Golems were not aggressive
against kids so this place was a safe ground for poor families’
childeren or orphans to earn a little money. Though the golems would
drive away any adult or attack it.</p>
<p>After some time the boy opened his mouth again. “More golems are
watching us. You know what that means ,right? Our time in here is about
to end.” Those two kids weren’t the only ones here. There were some
other younger kids them. But they only had one golem around them or
none. This was because the kids was getting older meaning they wouldn’t
be allow in a couple or so years later.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I guess I will find a job in the town. I wonder there are any
tailor who is looking for an apprentice.”</p>
<p>“What is the value of that. The army needs more of these shards. I
want to help as much as possible.”</p>
<p>The girl thought <em>why not become a soldier then?</em> But didn’t
voicalize them to avoid putting more dangerous ideas into the head of
her friend.</p>
<p>“Then I am going to get stronger and kill the witch. Retrive the
<em>Eater of the Worlds </em>and hand it to army so that they can erase
the demons from world.” The boy dreamed, only to add more frusturation
to the girl. The weapon was something that the witch protects. A weapon
that could vaporize all demons to nothingness.</p>
<p>The girl cheking if there is any hostility “You know all these golems
are witch’s servant. What would they do if you say that you will kill
their master.”</p>
<p>“I am pretty sure they would be thankfull being released under a
wretched, ugly, stinky wit…” the boys sentence cut with a tender hand of
the girl.</p>
<p>“You shouldn’t have said that, you idiot!”</p>
<p>But it was too late the golems already heard the insult towards their
beloved master. Even though they were ordered to not hurt kids in the
Garden of Golems they were angry. Since those small golems were not near
mature to the bigger ones they tend to act like that. The Gurardian
Golem was warning them but the little ones were so angry to hear their
parent’s call.</p>
<p>The girl rose to feet and pulled boy to get up as well.</p>
<p>“He is just dumb please let this pass for this once. I will
personally bea- ahem, educate him to never bad mouth others.” She was
trying to reason with the little boulders while looking for an opening
to run away. But to her avail she could only move little by little. Her
hand holding the wrist of boy tightly.</p>
<p>But the boy pulled shaked his hand of from the clutch if the girl
“Why are you scared? Those little rocks are just dumb and slow. I can
beat ten of them with ease. So let me say that, you master is just a
piece of shit ugly whore!”</p>
<p>“You imbecile!!!”</p>
<p>After hearing this not only the three golem whatching the two kids
but other golem also started to walk towards them. The girl pulled the
boy again and started to backstep while watching the golems. Running
backwards was meaningless since the exit was on the opposite side. Also
golems are scattered everywhere anyways. She looked for any opening
while moving backward only as much as the golems coming to them. Only
way was pass them and and run to the exit. If only one of the golems
stumbled they could use that opprtunity. But they weren’t lucky and hit
something from the behind.</p>
<p>Something black and purple. Emmiting an aura that makes someone dizzy
just by being near. No, it isn’t a thing but a being. One of the biggest
enemies of the humanity, Witch of the Dollhouse. Her pointy hat and long
robe was was pitch black like a moonless night. Her purple dress
underneat was the same color of the witch’s eyes. The eyes of a being
that is beyond a human comprehension. Yet scary, she was a beauty that
never seen anywhere.</p>
<p>The girl turned her back to golems. Compeared to the witch they were
nothing but a little problem. She was sure that they can’t shake of the
witch. The witch who killed many heroes and their strong companions,
only to send their eyes stolen heads to the enterence. She studied the
violet eyes of the witch, trying to gauge her intentions.</p>
<p>“Okay little boys that much is enough! You know they are just kids,
and kids say rude stuff without realizing what they say.”</p>
<p>With the witch’s intervention golems stopped. Not only they stopped
but shaked their round stone body as if bowing to apogolize.</p>
<p>“I understand why you are angry just for once I will forgive you
since nothing happened. But there might be some consequences if this
happens again” the witch was smiling but her gem like eyes wasn’t. All
golems runned with their top speed. And many falled down and get up only
to run more. If only they had made this mistake before…</p>
<p>“So darling, I came here to see who is up to my head. What you think?
Am I not too ugly right?” the witch mocked the boy. Forget about being
ugly she was so beautiful that his brain stopped functioning.</p>
<p>“I was a bit interested when I heard a kid was up to my life. To see
a useless wretch. He is just a little inteligent monkey. Your generic
human boy. Neither his eyes have any charm nor his soul have any
flavor.”</p>
<p>The witch didn’t only come to save the little ones but examine them
as well. She was looking if these yet to bloom flowers was any good to
pick up. The flower she hoped was a utter fiasco. Not even a flower but
a weed. But for her chance she saw an interesting breed near to
weed.</p>
<p>She is studying my face to see what I am thinking. Calculating how
she and her friend can leave here in one piece. Those glints, showing
inteligence but not cunning. The courage to hold herself, even though
her legs shake and she sweats her eyes are still. Oh my how a fine soul
is this. As if I am not looking to a frail girl but a wolf trying to
protect its kin. Hmm…</p>
<p>Upon finding a bud with a potential to bloom beautifully wicth’s
smile on her face reached to her eyes as well. Her amathyst eyes
charming anyone who looked upon. The girl saw her reflection on those
eyes. A reflection of a girl’s not a scared face but a face dyed to
admiarement.</p>
<p>Witch stepped towards to boy. The girl who tried to protect him
forget that she was the witch. No she knew she was the witch and how
dangerous she was. Yet her small brain was paralyzed. She couldn’t think
anything to do at the moment. You really need to have a rather poor eyes
to find me charming even though you had her.</p>
<p>Witch streched her hand and put it to boy’s chin only to close the
agape mouth of the silly boy’s “You are really going to be a scumbag if
you look at any woman even though you have a flower of yours.” Then she
directed her attention from weed to the little bud yet to blossom.</p>
<p>“An advice from a person who lived for certirues. You shouldn’t
really tie the knot with this monkey. He would put all his money to some
gold digger while leaving you and your childeren hungry.”</p>
<p>The girl who exhausted her mental power to process what the witch
meant looked up to her dumbfoundly. Only to shake her head to get our of
the enchant. She looked up to witch again with the same eyes of a wolf.
She was ready to sacrifice even herself right now.</p>
<p>Ohh how marvelous! I want to pick up her just here, should I? I can
end her before she feels anything. Ahh… I shall refrain. Her soul is
still fluid not solid enough. Her eyes still not mature enough.</p>
<p>Picking up a bud that has not bloomed yet was a crime even the witch
wouldn’t commit. But it was tempting to do so. Collecting a bud and
preserving her never to be seen blossom. What if she lose the the bud in
the forest and couldn’t find it. Hmm I should make some arrengments to
see her blossom. Maybe I can pull up the weed near her so that I can
find it again. Hmm… but this bud seems to be friend with that weed. If I
kill this monkey here would she come after me for revenge. Maybe she
would bully golems. I could use these kids to train her. Then when she
grows more she wanders about the endless labyrith gaining more strenght.
Gaining more vivid colors. Dying her with the color of revenge and
loathing.</p>
<p>The witch cupped the girl’s cheek. Scrathing it with her black pierce
nails. The girl was scared yet didn’t move back.</p>
<p>She looks a bit obidient actually. Well wolves are ancestors of dogs
in the end. I can tame her easily. Just make her stay here for exchange
of some money for her guardians and she would be here with her own
volition. Give her some tasks than praise her. Don’t let her get much
affection from others. And a little bit punishment when she makes some
mistake and she will become my little puppy. Hmm but I am not looking
for a pet, am I?</p>
<p>The witch completely beaware of her surroundings forgeting that even
the boy existed. She started to feel the girl’s lips with her thumb.
<em>Soft and warm. Though you don’t need that. I will make a better pot
that never detoriate. But how should I raise you in the first
place.</em></p>
<p>The witch pulled her hand momenteraly only to put it onto the girl’s
head “What is your name dear? Would you mind telling this old lady your
name?” The girl fidgeting a bit said with a shaky voice “Y- Yûkiba! My
name is…”</p>
<p>“What a nice name that resonates with your soul”</p>

<blockquote>勇牙｛yuu・kiba｝courage + fang</blockquote>

<p>“You can come here till your soul becomes rigid. I hope you will
visit me from the other door when you become an eye catching lady.”</p>
<p>With this departing words the witch turned into a black smoke and
disappared from sight.</p>
<p>The kids returned to their orphanage. When the nice sister has seen
Yukiba, teasing her about finding a partner in young age, “Which boy has
given you that flower, what a nice anemone is it?” At that moment,
Yukiba felt around her ear.</p>
<p>Then she realized the witch gave her a small gift…</p>

<blockquote>anemone means expectation, watchfull eye and love in flower
language</blockquote>


<h2 id="faulty-dolls">Faulty dolls</h2>
<hr>
<p>The witch who didn’t actually teleport but turning invinsible watched
the dumbfounded girl getting to her senses and running away with the
boy. “hmm♬…hmm♬” she couldn’t help but hum a song. Only to stop hearing
someone nearing her and saying.</p>
<p>“Meister, cheating is not good. Look I am crying.” Another girl who
appeared out of nowhere faked a crying. Using a flower patterned elegant
handkerchief to wipe nonexistent tears.</p>
<p>She in her dark blue dress was like a deep ocean. As frilly as her
master’s dress it was also adorned with many cloth made flower. Her Jet
black eyes was reflecting the person she cherished more than anything.
Her flat dark brown hair was stationed with a dark handband with white
frills a dahlia made out of cloth. With her pale and spotless skin she
was looking like a well-made life size doll. Her motions was quite
different it was elegant yet different than a human would move as if her
body has ball joints. Her mouth has pearl like yet sharp saw like teeth.
But her tongue was completely dry as if she didn’t produce any saliva.
She was cold and hard as if she wasn’t made out of flesh and blood but
some other material. Her only human parts are her hair and eyes.</p>
<p>**dahlia actually has some other meanings but in victoria era it
means; devition, love, beauty and dignity which I found more fitting
than creativity and positivty.</p>
<p>** “I’ve done nothing that counts as cheating, Kurubana.” The witch
protested. might be also read as <code>Kyobana</code> 狂華｛kuru・bana｝
madness + flower (poetic)</p>
<p>“You are a <em>philanderer </em>as always. Though, that’s also one of
the things I love about my meister.” Showing her shark like teeth with a
mad smile. “Always providing me more toys to break apart. Giving that
brat a flower as well. My meister, I am boiling with jealousy.”</p>
<p>The witch sighed and turned away her head to the gate where the
little wolf cub left the garden.</p>
<p>“You are not allowed follow her, can’t touch her until she reaches
your floor as well. Treat her as you do for other invaders.”</p>
<p>“If that is my meister’s wish I have nothing to do but to obey. I
will play with her to my heart content when she comes to my way,
though.” With one hand on her back she bowed the her master.</p>
<p>The dahlia on her headband swaying with the doll like dancing of
hers. She closed the gap between her and her master. Her face in front
of the beautiful violet eyes of the witch. Nearing to her that their
nose touches each other. The human eyes in a doll body looked up to her
master’s.</p>
<p>“…” </p>
 <p>   “…”</p>
<p>There was no need for the words. The connected eyes was the deliver
of their souls’ will to each others.</p>
<p>This girl… She is lying. She is going to pull some sort of tricks to
see wolf’s demise earlier. She is an eye catching flower. Beautiful,
elegant and a poisonious flower. A flower not only dangerous for her
admirers but also the nearby flowers who wants to take the attraction
from her. With the eyes of a dark abssy showing her twisted, thick,
sinister yet affectionatte soul. These black eyes looking at me… She
knows that I am aware of her plan. And she is also aware that I like her
who is trying to wither the flower that I want to collect and preserve
in a flower pot. How can I resist to such violent colors.</p>
<p>The witch, Witch of the dollhouse who is the master of the dollhouse
labyrith where the Eater of Worlds is selaed, was the one who creates
the dolls. The golems were a mere toy that she made with some rocks and
the artificial souls created by the witch. But the dolls were created
from real souls. Not limited to but included human, animal and demon
souls. But not all the dolls where as well made as this girl. Quite the
opposite, this mad doll was made with utmost affection and care to the
every little detail. She added the best magical core she had. Made the
best looking dress with the highest quality clothes. Preserved her eyes
more than she cared for herself, so that she can look into her wicked
soul. I wonder where did my interest to that wolf cub went, well
whatever… The witch cupped the cold face of her retainer. Only to hear a
soft voice lacking a breath.</p>
<p>“Meister!” and with that the mad doll closed her eyes. Only to be
distaracted by another doll.</p>
<p>“I found Daria at last and even master is here, hi master!” A young
girl which was looking just a little bit older than the other girl who
escaped a little bit ago runned to them and hugged them both with her
frail arms.</p>
<p>“hehehe…” getting a headpat not only from her master but also from
her beloved big sister, she was the happiest creature in the entire
world.</p>
<p>With her white hair, not a hair of an old person but a hair which is
pure and glossy, and the red eyes she was like a snow rabbit of far
North. In contrast to the other two she had a white dress. It had the
most frill. With her hair tied into long twintails with daisy hair tie
she was like an embodiment of purity. Completely opposite of her
poisonious retainer.</p>
<p>“I only left for a minute and you searched for me right away. How
much are you dependent to me, Chiketsu” Kuruba said while holding her
sides and lifting her to air.</p>
<hr />

<blockquote>稚潔｛ち・けつ｝immature + pure </blockquote>

<p>“I love you even more than masterdoes. I will find you less than 30 seconds next time.”</p>
<p>This was a flower which died before blooming yet before withering
preserved in a special pot made by the witch, her purest doll made out
of the purest soul she encountered in her life. Of course she used her
original eyes for the doll to see her pure soul to the fullest.</p>
<p>“Meister, I am asking for permisson to drink tea with this little
gremlin.”</p>
<p>“Hmm… Count me in”</p>
<p>“Yaay! A tea party together.”</p>
